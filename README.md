How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Designing software requires testing and implementing code. Before initiatiing the implementation process the developer must understand what the proper sintax is to use the code for the desingatted language/library to implement it properly. Once I understand how to use the code I can start dveloping the software by coding what I would like to create. Throughout the implementation process I would leave comments in my code to use as a refrenec to understand the purpose of the code. Once I partially develop a section of the software I would test it to ensure that it runs as intended without any errors. This is the process I used for my project. After creating a small section I would test it to see what the outcome would be in the window. Tactics of this design approach can be used in future work to ensure that the code developed works as intended and that comments within the code to use as a refrence to understand what the purpose of the code is 

How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Developing programs is the same process as designing software. First I must understand what tools I need to create the program. Once I understand what tools are required to get the job done I move on to developing the code. The code must have comments within it to keep track of what it is intended to do. This allows the user to keep track of his code and understand it while reviewing it. After the code has been created it will be tested to see what the outcome will be. If the code does not provide the desired outcome I review it by looking at the commnets and seing where the mistake could have been made. This process was implemented while working on creating the 3D scene. It was important for me to ensure that the objects has the proper coordinates to so they could have the proper shape that the developer intended to create. My approach throughout each milestone has remained the same but with some slight differences such as adding texture, lighting, and color into the 3D scene.  

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science will help me reach my goals by allowing me to create/improve tools intended to facilitate tasks. The goal of computer science is to save time and be more productive by using and improving tools that people have at their disposal. Computational graphics and visualization has given me new skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway by creating a visual representation of what I would like to create. Furthermore, the graphics and visualization has given me a new tool that I can use in my future professional pathway if I ever need it.
